```

## Aim

1. To create the statistical summary of a data

2. To study normality of the data

## Packages used and syntax of R methods

For statistical summary of a given dataset, the `rbase` package will be used. To calculate skewness and kurtosis of dataset, the `ACSWR` is used.

>*Note:* The functions `skewness` and `kurtosis` from the `e1071` package are more generic functions. Another resouse is `moments` package. 

## Algorithm
* Step 1: Load the dataset

* Step 2: Load necessary packages

* Step 3: Calculate statistical summaries

* Step 4: Calculate the `skewness` and `kurtosis` of the numerical data

* Step 5: Report the results

## R code

```{r}
#loading package
library(ACSWR)
#loading data
data(yb)
#view structure of data
str(yb)

```
```{r}
# creating statistical summary

summary(yb)
```
```{r}
range(yb$Preparation_1); range(yb$Preparation_2) # list out ranges of data

```

```{r}
#skewness and kurtosis of preparation_1
skewcoeff(yb$Preparation_1); kurtcoeff(yb$Preparation_1)
```
```{r}
#skewness and kurtosis of preparation_2
skewcoeff(yb$Preparation_2); kurtcoeff(yb$Preparation_2)
```
#problems

1. if A=1,4,8,12 and B=4,8,12,16 Find (1). summary (2). skewness and Kurtosis

**solution**

```{r}
A=c(1,4,8,11,12)
summary(A)
```
```{r}
B=c(4,8,12,16)
summary(B)  
```
```{r}
#skewness and kurtosis of preparation_1
skewcoeff(A); kurtcoeff(A)
```
```{r}
#skewness and kurtosis of preparation_1
skewcoeff(B); kurtcoeff(B)
```




## Results & discussions

A distribution is normal then `mean=median=mode` and the skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 2. In this experiment statistical summaries of two variables are created. From the skewness and kurtosis measures, both the variables are positively skewed and `preparation_1` is lepto-kurtic and `preparation_2` is meso-kurtic. Based on the statistical summary and skewness and kurtosis measures, both the variables are different from a normal distribution.
